#### Talking about myself...

 I have experience with the development of Web Apps with React + Typescript + Material-UI, the creation of paginated RESTFUL APIs (HATEOAS), familiar with SQL Server database and / or PostgreSQL, modeling with Power Designer. I also have practice in creating RPA's with Power Automate and development of automated and interactive screens with Excel + VBA.
